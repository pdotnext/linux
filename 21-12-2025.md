## Explain $PS1
`[\u@\h \W]\$`
- First and last Character are literal `[ ]`
- Then you use `u` but to escape it we use `\u
- `@` is also an liternal
- W stands for pwd and it also needs to be escape `\W`, use `w` for entire path
- finally we escape `\$` dollar

## STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR

- 0 - STDIN
- 1 - STDOUT
- 2- STDERR
