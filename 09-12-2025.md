# What I learned today - 12 Dec, 2025

RHEL has some advanced settings and some settings cannot be applied based on what you see on man pages.
You can control ssh timeout per user using the following code in sshd_config file

```shell
# This will not work in RHEL9
Match User harry509
    ClientAliveInterval 60
    ClientAliveCountMax 3
```

## Alt + . to get previous argument
If you wish to use previous argument of the last command, you can use `alt + .` but on mac this does not work.
To make is work, open terminal app settings, then profile and then select keyboard and there just select `Use Option as Meta key` checkbox. But then it create another problem, it does not all `~`and `|` keys.

## Public key

The Public part of the ssh key is stored in two location

- ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the server
- ~/.ssh/known_hosts on the client

On the server side you can change the location of ssh by editing sshd_config file.
