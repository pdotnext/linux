# Using extended file attributes to protect sensitive files

You can make the file immutable i.e. no one change it or you can add the content to the file but only at the end of the file.

- flag `a` is append the file but no overwrite or no delete
- flag `i` is immutable

```shell

sudo chattr +a nameofthefile
echo "added at the end of the file" >> nameofthefile

# remote the attributes
sudo chattr -a nameofthefile
```

Now lets try the same thing with immutable flag

```shell
sudo chattr +i nameofthefile
echo "added at the end of the file" >> nameofthefile # <- this fails

# remove the attribute
sudo chattr -i nameofthefile
```
