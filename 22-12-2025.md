If you wish to avoid overwriting of the file use

## Option noclobber

```shell
set -o noclobber

echo "set -o noclobber" > example
set -o noclobber
echo "set -o noclobber" > example
# --- output
# zsh: file exists: example
# In you wish to overwrite, try below
8:58:44 ~ $ echo "set -o noclobber overwrite" >| example
8:58:56 ~ $ cat example
#
# --- Description
set -o noclobber overwrite
```

## Using tr and file redirection

The file I created above, can be used below.</br>
We take that file, change all letters to upper case </br>
and send the output to tr-example file. Note the `<` and `>` it is fundamental </br>
important to understand this.

```shell
tr [:lower:] [:upper:] < example > tr-example
```

There are times when you do not want any output from your command. </br>
Below I'm looking for text files which were modified in last 7 days </br>
and using tar compressed in directory called backup

```shell
find . -iname '*.txt' -mtime -7 -exec \
tar cJf /home/zorro/zare/backup.tar.xz {} \; >/dev/null 2>&1
```

## Different types of shells

### Non Login Shells
Non-Login shells are the one when you open terminal emulator </br> 
(Gnome Terminal) on the desktop machine.

### Login Shells

Login shells are the one where you open a session on the </br>
remote server using ssh or using Ctrl + Alt + F1 </br>
You can also start a login shell using `bash -l` </br>
And .bash_profile is the only file used for login shell. </br>
But this file is referring back to .bashrc file, </br>
which means .bashrc is used for both non and login shells. </br>

### How to check if you are using login shells or not?

```shell
# below is on the Fedora server
12:48:58 ~ $ shopt login_shell
#
# --- Output --
# login_shell    	on

# below is on the Fedora Desktop
12:48:58 ~ $ shopt login_shell
#
# --- Output --
# login_shell    	off
```

## Add path

First echo out path and then edit .bashrc file to add path

```shell
14:52:17 ~ $ echo $PATH
# --- Output --- #
# /home/zorro/.local/bin:/home/zorro/bin:/usr/local/bin
# Find the line in bashrc file and change as below
PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$HOME/bin:$PATH:/opt"
```

Always apptend to $PATH, because in this case $PATH is environment </br>
variables and gives priority to executables in that path. </br>
Above, priority is given to .local and bin path. </br>

There is another method to do this, which append the PATH at </br>
the end of this file

```shell
echo export PATH=$PATH:/pathOftheDirectory
```

## Shell options

when you set -o command you get all options are available </br>
at shell level to configure.

```shell
set -o
#
# --- Output ---
1 allexport       off # with this no need to use export
2 braceexpand     on
3 emacs           on
4 errexit         off
5 errtrace        off
6 functrace       off
7 hashall         on
8 histexpand      on
9 history         on
10 ignoreeof       off
11 interactive-comments    on
12 keyword         off
13 monitor         on
14 noclobber       off # we have already used this above
15 noexec          off
16 noglob          off
17 nolog           off
18 notify          off
19 nounset         off
20 onecmd          off
21 physical        off
22 pipefail        off
23 posix           off
24 privileged      off
25 verbose         off
26 vi              off
27 xtrace          off
```

To set the option ON e.g. noclobber which we learned but </br>
to turn off, you need to use the following method

```shell
set +o noclobber # to turn off use +o
# to turn on
set -o noclobber
```
