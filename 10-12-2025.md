# Things learnt today 10.12.2025

I always knew how to set the permissions on the file using octal or normal method.
But to find what exactly is a permission on the file esp in octal format, I found today

```shell
stat -c %a  /etc/ssh/sshd-banner

# to find permissions on all files inside a pwd
stat -c '%a %n' *

```
