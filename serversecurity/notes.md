## Source of bugs
- If someone is going to compromise your server, </br> 
the most likely attack will either be through
a vulnerability </br> in a web application or other **service** the server hosts or through SSH.
- New vulnerabilities are found in applications or libraries all the time.
- How to set up a remote syslog server to make it more difficult for an attacker to cover her tracks.

## Think about auditing you have define standards
It will be easier for your team and for **external auditors** </br>
to validate your configuration, if you try to keep files and </br>
executables in their `standard | defined` places and </br> 
try to stick to default configurations when possible.

## Why your environment should be homogeneous?
The more homogeneous your environment, the easier it will </br>
be to keep up with different versions of software, </br>
So you will have an easier time if you can stick to a </br>
single Linux distribution and a particular version of </br>
that distribution. Distribution security mailing lists </br>
**won’t cover any third-party software** you run, however, </br>
so you will need to sign up for any security advisory </br>
lists those products provide.
